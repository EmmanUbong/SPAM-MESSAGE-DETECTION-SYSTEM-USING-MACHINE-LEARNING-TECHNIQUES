# SPAM-MESSAGE-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES

1.3	Aim and Objectives
The aim of this study is to develop a spam message detection system in digital communication channels using a machine learning approach. The objectives of this study are to:
a.	Acquire the necessary dataset for the project.
b.	Preprocess and extract relevant features from the dataset.
c.	Design an ML framework for accurate and early detection of spam messages.
d.	Implement and evaluate the performance of the developed framework in (c) above.

1.4	Methodology
To accomplish the objectives of this study, the following methodology will be implemented:
a.	Gather the necessary datasets from a suitable message repository to obtain a diverse and representative collection of spam and non-spam messages.
b.	Create a database using MySQL to store and manage the collected datasets, ensuring efficient data retrieval and organization.
c.	Employ data mapping and transformation techniques to integrate data from various sources and formats into a unified format suitable for model training. Preprocess the data to improve its accuracy and reliability, which may involve tasks such as cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.
d. Perform data analysis to identify any outliers or anomalies within the dataset. Apply dimensionality reduction and feature selection techniques to effectively represent the data and remove irrelevant or redundant features.
e.	Design and implement an SVM model using Python programming tools, leveraging libraries such as scikit-learn for efficient model development and training.
f.	Evaluate the performance of the SVM model using various metrics derived from the confusion matrix, which provides insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
